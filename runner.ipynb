    "\n",
    "#### Quick Sort\n",
    "- **Problem**: Sorting a list of elements.\n",
    "- **Key Steps**:\n",
    "  1. Choose a pivot element from the array.\n",
    "  2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "  3. Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays.\n",
    "  4. Combine the sub-arrays and the pivot to form the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Best case (Ω): O(n log n) – Occurs when the pivot splits the array into two equal halves.\n",
    "  - Worst case (O): O(n²) – Occurs when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions.\n",
    "  - Average case (Θ): O(n log n) – Expected behavior with a good pivot selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recurrence Relation**: \n",
    "  - T(n) = T(k) + T(n - k - 1) + O(n), where k is the position of the pivot element.\n",
    "  - In the best and average cases, k = n/2, so T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solving**:\n",
    "  1. **Substitution method**: Assume T(n) = cn log n and substitute.\n",
    "  2. **Recursion-tree method**: Divide and conquer splits the array until size 1, which leads to log n depth with n work at each level.\n",
    "  3. **Master Theorem**: Matches the case a = 2, b = 2, and d = 1, so T(n) = O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Implications**: Quick Sort is widely used in practice due to its average-case efficiency and low overhead compared to other algorithms like Merge Sort. However, in worst-case scenarios (e.g., sorted arrays), Quick Sort can degrade to O(n²) unless optimizations like randomized pivot selection are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Sort\n",
    "- **Problem**: Sorting a list of elements.\n",
    "- **Key Steps**:\n",
    "  1. Divide the array into two halves.\n",
    "  2. Recursively sort each half.\n",
    "  3. Merge the two halves to produce a sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Best, Worst, and Average case: O(n log n) – Consistent performance since the array is always split evenly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recurrence Relation**: \n",
    "  - T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) – Two recursive calls on arrays of size n/2, with linear time to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solving**:\n",
    "  1. **Substitution method**: Assume T(n) = cn log n and substitute.\n",
    "  2. **Recursion-tree method**: The recursion tree has log n levels, and each level takes O(n) work.\n",
    "  3. **Master Theorem**: a = 2, b = 2, d = 1, so T(n) = O(n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Implications**: Merge Sort is stable and guarantees O(n log n) time complexity regardless of input order. It's particularly useful for large datasets or when stability is required. However, it requires additional space for merging, which can be a disadvantage in memory-constrained environments.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Time**: We measure the execution time using `time.time()` before and after running the algorithm.\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**: The `memory_usage()` function from the `memory_profiler` library captures the memory used before and after the algorithm runs. The difference is recorded as the memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Performance Analysis (Theoretical and Practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset type and size, the results will display the execution time and memory usage for both Quick Sort and Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Sort Performance:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Best Case**: O(n log n) – If the pivot splits the array evenly.\n",
    "  - **Worst Case**: O(n²) – If the pivot is always the smallest or largest element.\n",
    "  - **Average Case**: O(n log n).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) – Due to recursive function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Sort Performance:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - **Best, Worst, and Average Case**: O(n log n) – The array is always split evenly.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(n) – Requires additional space for merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Time**:\n",
    "  - Quick Sort may perform faster on random and sorted datasets, but its performance degrades on reverse-sorted datasets.\n",
    "  - Merge Sort has consistent performance across all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Usage**:\n",
    "  - Quick Sort uses less memory due to its in-place sorting mechanism.\n",
    "  - Merge Sort requires more memory because it needs extra space to merge arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrepancies Between Theory and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quick Sort**: In theory, Quick Sort can perform poorly in the worst-case scenario (reverse-sorted data). In practice, optimizations like randomized pivot selection can prevent this from happening. The average performance is generally very good.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Merge Sort**: The theoretical analysis aligns well with the practical results. Its consistent O(n log n) time complexity is evident across different types of input, but its higher memory usage is a notable drawback in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By profiling both time and memory usage, you can empirically verify the performance of these algorithms across different datasets. You’ll see that Quick Sort is faster for random datasets but degrades for worst-case scenarios, while Merge Sort is stable but more memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend this further by adding graphs and tables to visualize the results, which will help in writing your final report.\n",
